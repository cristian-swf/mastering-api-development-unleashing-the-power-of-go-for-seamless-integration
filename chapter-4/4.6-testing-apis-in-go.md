# 4.6: Testing APIs in Go

Testing is an essential aspect of software development, helping ensure the correctness, functionality, and reliability of your code. In Go, we have a built-in testing package that provides support for automated testing of Go packages. In this chapter, we'll cover how to unit test and integration test your API.

## Understanding Unit Testing and Integration Testing in Go

Unit testing is a method where individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. In the context of an API, a unit could be a single endpoint or a function. The idea is to write tests that isolate and verify the smallest pieces of your code.

Integration testing, on the other hand, is a type of testing to check if different pieces of the modules are working together. For APIs, this could mean testing how well routes handle requests and responses, interact with databases, or execute any other functions they depend on.

## Using the Testing Package, Mocking Dependencies, and Handling Test Coverage

Go's built-in `testing` package provides necessary tools to write unit tests. Let's take a look at a simple unit test for a function that adds two integers:

```go
package main

import "testing"

func add(a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    result := add(2, 3)
    if result != 5 {
        t.Errorf("Expected 5, but got %d", result)
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a function `TestAdd` that tests the add function. The `TestAdd` function takes a single parameter of type `*testing.T`, which provides methods for indicating test failures and logging supporting information.

For testing APIs, we often have dependencies like databases or third-party services. To unit test, we need to mock these dependencies. Let's consider a simple handler function that interacts with a `UserService` to get a user:

```go
type UserService interface {
	GetUser(id string) (User, error)
}

func GetUserHandler(s UserService) http.HandlerFunc {
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		id := r.URL.Query().Get("id")
		user, err := s.GetUser(id)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
		json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(user)
	}
}
```

In this case, to unit test `GetUserHandler`, you would need to mock the `UserService`.

Go also provides a built-in way to check test coverage with the `go test -cover` command. This will output the percentage of your code that is covered by tests.
