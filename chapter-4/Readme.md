# Chapter 4
**Build and test APIs**: Dive deep into Go's powerful tools and libraries, such as Gorilla Mux, Gin, and Echo, to create efficient, testable, and robust APIs.

***

As you dive deeper into API development with Go, it's important to familiarize yourself with the powerful tools and libraries the language offers. These can simplify and streamline your development process, making it easier to create efficient, testable, and robust APIs.

In this chapter, we'll explore several of these tools and libraries in-depth, including Gorilla Mux, Gin, and Echo. Each of these provides unique features and benefits, and understanding how to leverage them effectively can be a significant asset in your API development journey.

We'll also delve into the crucial task of testing your APIs. You'll learn about different testing strategies in Go, how to write effective tests, and how to use the built-in testing package.

Finally, we'll cover the importance of API documentation, how to write it, and how to use tools to automate the process. We'll also discuss how to optimize and refactor your API for performance and maintainability.

By the end of this chapter, you should be well-equipped to build and test your own APIs in Go, using some of the best tools and practices available. So let's dive in!
