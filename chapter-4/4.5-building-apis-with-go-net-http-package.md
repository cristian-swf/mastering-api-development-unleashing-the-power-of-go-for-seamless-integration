# 4.5: Building APIs with Go net/http package

Go's standard library is very powerful and comes with excellent support for building APIs without the need for any third-party frameworks. If you prefer a minimalistic approach and wish to avoid additional dependencies, you can build APIs using native Go functions. This chapter will guide you through the process.

## Exploring Go net/http package

Go's standard net/http package provides functionalities to build HTTP servers and clients. This includes the ability to create routes, handle requests and responses, work with HTTP methods, headers, and status codes.

Some of the key functions and types from the net/http package that you'll use when building an API include:
- `http.HandleFunc`: This function registers a function to be called whenever a request is made to a particular path.
- `http.ListenAndServe`: This function starts an HTTP server at a specified address.
- `http.Request`: This type represents an HTTP request received by a server or to be sent by a client.
- `http.ResponseWriter`: This interface is used by an HTTP handler to construct an HTTP response.

## Building an API using Go net/http package

Building an API with Go's native functions involves defining handlers for different routes and starting an HTTP server. Here's an example of a simple API:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, world!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

In this example, we define a handler `helloHandler` for the route /hello. When a client makes a request to this route, the server responds with "Hello, world!".

## Middleware in an API using Go net/http package

Middleware can also be implemented using native Go functions. Here's an example of a simple logging middleware:

```go
func loggingMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		log.Printf("Request received: %s %s", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
		next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	})
}
```

In this example, `loggingMiddleware` logs the HTTP method and path of each incoming request. It uses `http.Handler` and `http.HandlerFunc`, which are built-in interfaces and functions in Go's `net/http` package.

To use this middleware, you would need to use `http.Handle` instead of `http.HandleFunc`, like so:

```go
func main() {
	helloHandler := http.HandlerFunc(hello)
	http.Handle("/hello", loggingMiddleware(helloHandler))
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Go's native functions provide a powerful, minimalist way to build APIs. It allows you full control over your code and avoids the overhead that some third-party libraries might add. However, for complex applications, a well-crafted third-party framework might make development easier by reducing boilerplate and providing additional utilities.
