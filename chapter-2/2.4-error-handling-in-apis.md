# 2.4 Error Handling in APIs: Learn best practices for handling errors in your APIs

Proper error handling is essential for building robust and user-friendly APIs. When something goes wrong, your API should provide clients with clear, actionable information to help them diagnose and resolve the issue. In this chapter, we will discuss best practices for handling errors in your APIs, including standard HTTP status codes, custom error messages, and error response structures.

## Standard HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are a standardized way of indicating the result of an HTTP request. They provide a high-level indication of whether the request was successful, had client-side errors, or encountered server-side issues. When handling errors in your API, it is essential to use the appropriate HTTP status codes. 

Some common status codes include:

* **200 - OK**: The request was successful.
* **201 - Created**: A new resource was successfully created.
* **400 - Bad Request**: The request was malformed or invalid.
* **401 - Unauthorized**: The request requires authentication, and the client has not provided valid credentials.
* **403 - Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
* **404 - Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
* **500 - Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server-side while processing the request.

## Custom Error Messages

In addition to using standard HTTP status codes, your API should provide custom error messages that give clients more context about what went wrong. Custom error messages should be clear, concise, and actionable, helping clients understand the issue and how to resolve it.

## Error Response Structure

To ensure consistency across your API, define a standard error response structure that includes the necessary information for clients to diagnose and resolve issues. A common error response structure might include:

* **status**: The HTTP status code of the error.
* **message**: A human-readable description of the error.
* **code**: A machine-readable error code that uniquely identifies the specific error.
* **details**: (Optional) Additional information or context about the error, such as validation errors or data that caused the issue.

Here's an example of an error response structure in JSON format:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Invalid email address.",
  "code": "INVALID_EMAIL",
  "details": {
    "field": "email",
    "value": "john.doe@invalid"
  }
}
```

By implementing proper error handling practices in your API, you can make it easier for clients to diagnose and resolve issues, leading to a better overall user experience. Make sure to use standard HTTP status codes, provide clear and actionable custom error messages, and maintain a consistent error response structure throughout your API.

## Detailed example


In the example below we have a custom error message implementation in Go using the `net/http` package. This example demonstrates how to create a custom error response with a specific structure and how to return it as a JSON response.

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"
)

// ErrorResponse represents the custom error message structure.
type ErrorResponse struct {
	Status  int    `json:"status"`
	Message string `json:"message"`
	Code    string `json:"code"`
}

// Custom error codes
const (
	InvalidEmailCode = "INVALID_EMAIL"
)

func main() {
    //Create a route to validate email address.
	http.HandleFunc("/validate-email", validateEmailHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func validateEmailHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Simulate an invalid email address. 
    //You can perform here your own check to see if the email address is valid.
	invalidEmail := true

	// If the email is invalid, return a custom error message.
	if invalidEmail {
		w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)

		errorResponse := ErrorResponse{
			Status:  http.StatusBadRequest,
			Message: "Invalid email address.",
			Code:    InvalidEmailCode,
		}

		json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(errorResponse)
		return
	}

	// ... Handle the valid email address case here.
}
```

In this example, we define an `ErrorResponse` struct that represents our custom error message structure. We also define a custom error `code`, `InvalidEmailCode`, for the invalid email error. In the `validateEmailHandler` function, we simulate an invalid email address check and return an `ErrorResponse` instance as a JSON response with the appropriate status code and headers when the email is invalid.
