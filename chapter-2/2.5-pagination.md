# Pagination

When returning large data sets in your API, it is essential to implement pagination to improve performance and make the response more manageable for clients. Pagination allows clients to retrieve data in smaller chunks, reducing the load on the server and making it easier for clients to process the response. In this chapter, we will explore different techniques for implementing pagination in your APIs, including offset-based pagination, cursor-based pagination, and keyset pagination.


## Offset-based Pagination

Offset-based pagination is a widely-used method that involves specifying the starting index (offset) and the number of items to return (limit) in the request. The server then returns a subset of the data based on these parameters.

Example request:

```bash
GET /users?offset=0&limit=10
```

Pros:
* Simple to implement and understand
* Works well with most databases and query languages

Cons:
* Inefficient for large data sets, as the database must scan all items up to the offset
* Prone to inconsistencies if items are added or removed between requests

## Cursor-based Pagination

Cursor-based pagination uses a unique identifier (cursor) that points to a specific item in the dataset. Instead of specifying an offset, clients provide a cursor indicating where to start retrieving items. The server returns the specified number of items following the cursor and provides a new cursor for the next request.

Example request:

```bash
GET /users?cursor=eyJ1c2VySWQiOiAiMTAwIn0=&limit=10
```

Pros:
* More efficient than offset-based pagination, especially for large datasets
* Less likely to result in inconsistencies when items are added or removed

Cons:
* More complex to implement, particularly with databases that do not support efficient querying by a specific field
* Requires clients to understand and handle cursor tokens

## Keyset Pagination

Keyset pagination, also known as "seek method" pagination, involves using the values of one or more fields (keys) to determine the starting point for fetching items. Clients provide the values of these fields for the last item in the previous page, and the server returns items that follow the specified keyset.

Example request:

```bash
GET /users?last_id=100&limit=10
```

Pros:
* Efficient even for large data sets, as the database can use indexes to seek directly to the specified keys
* More consistent than offset-based pagination when items are added or removed

Cons:
* Requires a unique and sortable field (or combination of fields) in the data set
* Can be more difficult to implement, depending on the database and query language

When implementing pagination in your APIs, consider factors such as simplicity, performance, and consistency. Each pagination method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach will depend on your specific use case, requirements and the database engine you're using. That's why it's important to understand the tradeoffs of each method and choose the one that best fits your needs.

Regardless of the technique you choose, make sure to provide clear documentation for clients on how to use pagination effectively.
