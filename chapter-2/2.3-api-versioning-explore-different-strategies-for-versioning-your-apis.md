# 2.3 API Versioning: Explore different strategies for versioning your APIs

API versioning is a crucial aspect of maintaining long-term compatibility between your API and its clients. As your API evolves, you may introduce breaking changes that require clients to update their implementations. Versioning allows you to manage these changes gracefully, ensuring that existing clients continue to function as expected. In this chapter, we will explore different strategies for versioning your APIs, including URI versioning, query parameter versioning, and custom header versioning.

## URI Versioning

URI versioning is a common approach that involves including the API version in the URI. Clients specify the desired version by including it in their requests. For example:

```bash
GET /v1/users
GET /v2/users
```

URI versioning is simple to implement and easy for clients to understand. However, it can lead to cluttered URIs and may require additional server-side routing logic.

## Query Parameter Versioning

With query parameter versioning, the API version is specified as a query parameter in the request. For example:

```bash
GET /users?version=1
GET /users?version=2
```

This approach keeps the base URI clean and allows for more granular versioning of individual resources or endpoints. However, it may be less intuitive for clients and can complicate caching strategies.

## Custom Header Versioning

Custom header versioning involves specifying the API version using a custom HTTP header. Clients include the version in the request headers, and the server uses this information to determine which version of the API to serve. For example:

```bash
GET /users
Headers: { "X-API-Version": "1" }

GET /users
Headers: { "X-API-Version": "2" }
```

This approach keeps both the URI and query parameters clean, and it can be more flexible than the other methods. However, it may be less discoverable for clients and can require additional server-side logic to parse and handle the custom header.

When choosing an API versioning strategy, consider factors such as simplicity, discoverability, and ease of implementation. Each method has its pros and cons, and the best approach will depend on your specific use case and requirements. Regardless of the strategy you choose, it is essential to communicate versioning changes clearly to your clients and provide documentation on how to upgrade to new versions.

## Our recommendation

**URI versioning** is considered by many to be the best way to version an API due to its simplicity, clarity and ease of use for both API developers and clients. While there are alternative versioning methods, such as query parameter versioning and custom header versioning, URI versioning has certain advantages that make it a popular choice.

Here are some reasons why URI versioning is often considered the best approach:

* **Simplicity**: Including the version number directly in the URI makes it straightforward for developers to implement and maintain. There is no need for complex server-side logic to handle versioning, as routing can be easily configured based on the version in the URI.

* **Discoverability**: Since the version number is part of the URI, it is immediately visible and easy to understand for clients. This makes it less error-prone, as clients are less likely to use an incorrect version accidentally.

* **Clear separation of versions**: URI versioning allows for a clean separation of different API versions, making it easier to maintain multiple versions simultaneously. This can be especially useful during the transition period when clients are migrating from an older version to a newer one.

* **Caching**: Because the version number is part of the URI, caching mechanisms can treat different versions of the API as separate resources. This ensures that cache entries for different API versions do not interfere with each other.

* **Compatibility with tooling**: Many API management tools, proxies, and gateways work well with URI versioning, as they can easily route requests based on the URI path. This makes it easier to integrate your API with existing infrastructure.

However, it is important to note that the best versioning approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your API and its clients. While URI versioning has several advantages, the other 2 methods discussed above may be more suitable in some cases.
